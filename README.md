# Lab11PokeCatcher

## HTML Plan
- have main site page and a results page 
- need a short instructional on what this site does and how to do the thing
- need 3 pokemans to show up and be clickable(generated and appended in js)
- have encountered and caught in a div on results page
 


## JS Plan
- need to load initial 3 pokemans.
- need to check round #
- if rounds = 10 send to results page
On click:
- make 3 new pokemans
- make sure theyre unique 
- if encountered before increment if not create "cart" item
- clicked pokemans increment caught 
- increment rounds by 1
- repeat


## CSS Plan
- good luck
